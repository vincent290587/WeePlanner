    <description>This is the first week for our Virtual Training Group, welcome!  Also, welcome to everyone else who is joining!  This workout is meant to start the base phase of your training, and ease you back into longer structured rides.  So, if you are looking for a hammerfest, this isn&apos;t your ride.  This workout features pedaling drills, position changes, cadence changes, and loads of time spent at Endurance and Tempo zones with minimal rest to really target that aerobic engine.

This workout is 90 minutes in duration, carries ~85 TSS, and has an IF of .74.

Description:

PEDALING DRILLS:
-We are working on your pedaling mechanics and basic skills here. These drills will help make you a more efficient rider, pedal with less wasted energy, and gain some &quot;free&quot; speed as you will be better able to put power through the entire pedal stroke instead of just the push down and pull up phases as most riders do. Imagine pedaling in circles rather than having 2 pistons for legs.
---
-Single Leg Drill - Unclip 1 leg and rest it on the trainer or let it hang off to the side. Continue to pedal with the 1 leg clipped in for 30 seconds. Really work on pedaling with no dead spots in the pedal stroke and maintaining the same cadence you had with 2 feet. After 30 seconds, clip both feet for 30 seconds, then unclip the opposite side performing 30 seconds on that leg. Perform 3 times each leg.
---
-Spin-ups - Really easy gear here. Spin your legs as fast as you can (ideally 110+ cadence) without your bum bouncing in the saddle or lurching back and forth. Strong core and bum planted! 30 seconds spin-ups, 30 seconds rest, 3 times.
------
MAIN SET:
-5x 10 minutes @Endurance and @Tempo zones, in pyramid format.
-We start at 75% FTP and top off at 85% FTP before going back down again.
-2 minutes rest between intervals here. Intentionally short to keep that heart rate elevated!
-We will be practicing changes in position, cadence, and sitting/standing throughout the intervals to break up the time, but also expose where your weaknesses are
